# Edit Ticket Implementation

## Summary
Successfully implemented the "Edit Ticket" functionality in the Ticket Management System.

## Date
January 2025

## Changes Made

### 1. Created EditTicket.jsx Page
**Location:** `/MAC/mac-tickets-front/src/pages/tickets/EditTicket.jsx`

**Features:**
- Loads existing ticket data by ID from the API
- Reuses the existing `TicketForm` component with `initialData` prop
- Validates user permissions (admin, creator, or assignee can edit)
- Shows loading state while fetching ticket data
- Shows error state if ticket not found or permission denied
- Calls `updateTicket` API endpoint on form submission
- Displays success notification on save
- Redirects to ticket detail page after successful update
- Matches Figma design with red dot header and consistent styling
- Full dark mode support

### 2. Updated Router Configuration
**Location:** `/MAC/mac-tickets-front/src/App.jsx`

**Changes:**
- Added import for `EditTicket` component
- Added route for `/tickets/:id/edit` (placed before `/tickets/:id` to avoid route conflicts)
- Wrapped with `ProtectedLayout` for authentication

### 3. Updated Exports
**Location:** `/MAC/mac-tickets-front/src/pages/tickets/index.js`

**Changes:**
- Added export for `EditTicket` component

### 4. Existing Components Reused
The following components were already prepared for edit functionality:

**TicketForm.jsx:**
- Already supports both create and edit modes via `initialData` prop
- Shows "Crear Ticket" or "Actualizar Ticket" button text based on mode
- Pre-populates form fields when `initialData` is provided

**TicketDetail.jsx:**
- "Editar Ticket" button already navigates to `/tickets/${id}/edit` (line 192)
- Permission check already in place (line 157)

**ticketService.js:**
- `updateTicket` method already implemented (line 51)
- Calls `PUT /tickets/:id` endpoint

## Backend Support

The backend already had full support for ticket updates:

**Endpoint:** `PUT /api/tickets/:id`
**Controller:** `ticketController.updateTicket` (ticketController.js:158)
**Service:** `ticketService.updateTicket` (ticketService.js)
**Route:** Configured in tickets.js:45
**Authentication:** Required via authMiddleware
**Permissions:** Checked in service layer (admin, creator, or assignee)

## User Flow

1. User views ticket detail page
2. Clicks "Editar Ticket" button (if they have permission)
3. Navigates to `/tickets/:id/edit`
4. EditTicket page loads existing ticket data
5. TicketForm displays with pre-populated fields
6. User modifies ticket information
7. Clicks "Actualizar Ticket" button
8. Form validates input
9. API call to `PUT /tickets/:id` with updated data
10. Success message displayed
11. Redirects to ticket detail page after 1.5 seconds

## Permissions

Users can edit a ticket if they are:
- **Admin** - can edit any ticket
- **Creator** - can edit tickets they created
- **Assignee** - can edit tickets assigned to them

## UI/UX Features

- **Loading State:** Shows spinner while loading ticket data
- **Error Handling:** Clear error messages for not found or permission denied
- **Success Feedback:** Snackbar notification on successful update
- **Cancel Action:** Returns to ticket detail page
- **Form Validation:** All required fields validated before submission
- **Dark Mode:** Full dark mode support

- **Figma Consistency:** Matches design system (red accents, white headers, gray backgrounds)
